\section{Introducing the dungeon}
% Use the highlight environment to.. well highlight things
\begin{highlight}[The journey begins] % optional title
  As you make your way through the dense forest, you notice an unusual structure hidden among the trees. 
  It's a small cave, made of rough-hewn stone and nestled into the earth. 
  The entrance is dark and foreboding, but you sense that there is something valuable hidden inside.
  
  As you approach the entrance, you see that the doorway is covered in strange markings and symbols. 
  They seem to pulse with an otherworldly energy, and you feel a sense of unease wash over you. 
  But your curiosity gets the better of you, and you step inside.
  
  The air inside the dungeon is thick and musty, and the darkness is oppressive. 
  You can barely see your hand in front of your face, but you can hear strange noises echoing through the darkness.
  You sense that this place was once used for something sinister.
